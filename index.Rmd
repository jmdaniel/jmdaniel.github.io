## 1. Choosing a public housing flat in Singapore

1. Singapore has had an extensive public housing program since its inception in 1960, managed by the Housing Development Board (HDB). 
  - 1+ millions flats, split between 23 HDB towns and 3 estates. 
  - Any HDB flat can be sold on the reseller market after 5 years of occupancy.

2. This application predicts the price of a public housing flat on the reseller market. Price is based on:
  - Location within Singapore: HDB town, 
  - The type of the flat: 2 Rooms, 5 rooms ...,
  - The flat model: standard, improved...
  - The storeys range: "07 TO 09", "10 TO 12" etc...,
  - Year when the lease started: all HDB flats have a 99 years lease at time of initial construction

3. The price prediction algorithm is using a Linear Model
  - Model built with the [Singapore Housing Development Board (HDB) Resale price dataset ](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices/resource/83b2fc37-ce8c-4df4-968b-370fd818138b).
  - Dataset includes 40,000 flats transations on the reseller market from 2014 o 2016, during which prices have ben relatively stable.

4. This application has been built with [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), a Web application framework for R.

5. Online application is available at [HDB Flat Price App](ttps://jmdaniel.shinyapps.io/HDBFlatPriceApp/)

## 2. Building Linear Model

*** =left
Construction of the Linear model:
```{r LinearModel, eval = FALSE}
fit_lmSimple <- lm(formula = resale_price ~ town + 
            flat_model * lease_start_date + flat_type + storey_range, 
            data = training)
```
Most important predictors:
```{r LoadPredictiveModel, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
source("./Library/HDBPredictiveModel.R")
hdb_flat <- getCleanHDBData()
fit_model <- buildModel(hdb_flat)
imp <- varImp(fit_model, scale = FALSE)
imp <- data.frame(ind = labels(imp)[[1]], MeanGini = imp$Overall)
```

```{r , eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, size="scriptsize"}
head(imp[order(imp$MeanGini, decreasing = TRUE), ], 4)
```
The resale price of a flat depends mostly on (decreasing order):
  - Location : HDB town
  - Number of years left of the lease
  - Type of appartment
  - Floor level

*** =right

Adjusted R squared of the linear model:
```{r , eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
round(summary(fit_model)$adj.r.squared, 3)
```
The price prediction will be carried with a 95% confidence interval.
Prediction of 3 ROOM flat, model A, floor "07 TO 09" in ANG MO KIO, with lease starting in 1995:

```{r}
ndata <- c("ANG MO KIO","3 ROOM", "Model A", "07 TO 09", 1995)
new_pred <- predict_price(fit_model, ndata)
new_pred$Price <- as.character(round(new_pred$Price / 1000, 0) * 1000)
new_pred$Lower <- as.character(round(new_pred$Lower / 1000, 0) * 1000)
new_pred$Upper <- as.character(round(new_pred$Upper / 1000, 0) * 1000)
new_pred
```

## 3. Shiny User Interface

*** =left
The application User Interface reflects the important predictors that have been identified by the statistical model.

*** =right 
To compute the resale price, we use a reactive variable, which is triggered when the user clicks on "Compute resale price":

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
  # Predict the price using a reactive variable 
  prediction <- eventReactive(input$compute, {
    # Gather the input data
    ndata <- c(input$towns, input$types, input$models, 
               input$storeys, input$start_year_lease)
    
    # Predict the price using the Linear model
    new_pred <- predict_price(fit_model, ndata)
    
    # We add the new prediction to the previous one 
    # WITHOUT resetting the dataframe: use f "<<-"
    price_table <<- rbind(price_table, new_pred)
  })

  # Display the updated table with all predictions
  output$oselection <- renderTable ({prediction()})
```
The price is added to the price table and displayed.

## 4. Plotting predicted prices


*** =left 

When the user selects the tab "Flats on Singapore's map", the flat location is displayed with its characteristic and its indicative price. 
  - We use a Leaflet object to draw the Singapore map with the coordinates of the HDB towns. 
  - Example with a predicted price for a 4 ROOM flat with lease starting in 1980 in the HDB town "Bishan":

This map displays all HDB towns from the generated price table, with all selected flats.



Example of a recent HDB flat program: Pinnacle @ Duxton.
